                        practice programs. Each student, for him, is not a number but a soul on a unique journey. His teaching

                        Asana and Pranayama reflects his belief that the body is a temple and the breath is the bridge to
                        inner stillness. His classes are known for their personal attention, precise alignment, soulful silence,
                        and transformative energy.
